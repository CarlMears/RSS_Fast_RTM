the v4 msu files were made using the routine

B:\job_weighting_functions\process_msu_wt_funcs_by_surface_level.1100.v4.pro

the routine writes them to:

B:\job_weighting_functions\netcdf_files

then they are copied by hand to 

B:\idl_library\MSU_AMSU_simulation\method_1\wts

The V4 versions use the V4 FOV sets (central 9 istead of central 5)
for MSU TMT, TTS, and TLS.
